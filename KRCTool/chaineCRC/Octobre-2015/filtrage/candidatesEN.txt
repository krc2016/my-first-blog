pu u o mahana is the site of hawaii s famous green sand beach, composed of the shiny green mineral olivine a magnesium-iron-silicate eroded from the littoral cone and concentrated by wave action
the littoral cones that develop from these explosive ejections are typically open on the seaward side
the resulting steam explosions generated spatter , limu o pele , and pele s hair that accumulated on the sea cliff to make a littoral cone

littoral cones
littoral cones can develop at the water s edge from the accumulation of these airborne fragments

basalt exiting from lava tubes can also generate littoral cones from episodic explosions due to disruption of the lava stream by incoming waves or swells
larger deposits , however , are more permanent and form littoral cones , such as the 100-foot-high pu u o mahana , near the south tip of the big island , formed during a prehistoric mauna loa eruption
the interaction of lava and water generated an acidic steam plume , black sand , and , with the proper conditions , littoral cones
the exposed hot rocks and lava from the tube generated steam explosions that threw material back on the bench to produce a littoral cone
a littoral cone is a cone formed on a lava flow when it runs into a body of water , usually the sea
although littoral cones have a hydrovolcanic orgin , they are not true hydrovolcanic vents
large composite cones may generate a type of mudflow known as a lahar

they are typically steep-sided , symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows , volcanic ash , cinders , blocks , and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases
what we get up to is barely a science. so why bother tryin ? asks don rufino , standing in front of the 5,465-metre 17,930ft symmetrical cone. if the volcano decides it s time , we won t have time to do anything about it. he is more worried about soldiers enforcing the ban on going within six miles of the crater , which prevents villagers reaching their fields to harvest their maize
one of the most active volcanoes in cook inlet is augustine , whose symmetrical cone rises 1,254 meters above the sea
the 1994 reawakening , the scientists say , was triggered by a new injection of molten rock into the magma chamber , and the current intensification of activity is due to the formation of a lava dome inside the crater which is obstructing the regular release of energy
coarse debris in the same eruptive plume rains into the sea and settles on the flanks of the cone

the cataclysmic eruption and related events on may 18 rank among the most significant geologic events in the united states during the 20th century
in a clear effort at fence-mending during his two-day visit to montserrat , mr foulkes , whose predictions of a cataclysmic eruption by the island s active volcano sparked panic evacuations last month , said that whitehall and the local government had entered a new era of co-operation. now it is a new start and we are looking to the future and making an unequivocal commitment to both the people and the island of montserrat. mr foulkes said that he was looking at immediate needs such as housing , roads , upgrading the hospital and creating employment for the 5,000 islanders who have remained on montserrat since the soufriere hills volcano erupted two years ago for the first time in four centuries
modern skills in predicting eruptions go back to the aftermath of the cataclysmic eruption of mount st helens in washington state in 1980
cataclysmic eruptions 2.0 , 1.3 , and 0.6 million years ago ejected huge volumes of rhyolite magma; each eruption formed a caldera and extensive layers of thick pyroclastic-flow deposits
last month mr foulkes , reading from the wrong report by the montserrat volcano observatory , had predicted a cataclysmic eruption , sparking evacuation panic among islanders

we started with herculanaeum , which the children enjoyed , cavorting around the gardens and squirting fountain water
it was continuously in motion , rising and falling sometimes several hundred feet a day , with molten material surging against the crater walls , fountains spouting 30 feet high , and sulfurous fumes shrouding the crater
hawaiian eruptions typically start with lava fountains spouting from a series of nearly continuous fissures , curtains of fire. as most eruptions progress , lava-fountain activity becomes localized at a single vent an opening from which lava issues , generally within hours of the initial outbreak
to : a 40-foot arching hose fountain spurts from pu u o o vent in 1983
clouds of ash the volcano , europe s highest at 10,900 feet , pumped out huge dark clouds of ash and spurted fountains of magma 300 to 600 feet into the air
these tend to be cracks in the ground , rather than the familiar conical mountains , through which ``fire fountains spurt

during the 1959 kilauea iki eruption , lava fountains shot 1,900 feet , the record height for historic hawaiian eruptions and likely the highest lava fountain yet observed on earth
lava falling from fountains and issuing quietly from vents often forms incandescent lava streams or lava flows , leading to the colorful term rivers of fire, often used in popular accounts of hawaiian eruptions
less common are fountains that reach over 1,000 feet 300 m in height
26 september 1995 , p.1 volcano emergency alert / home news mount ruapehu , new zealand michael munro boulders , mud , ash and poisonous gases are hurled thousands of feet in the air as an eruption of mount ruapehu in new zealand s north island gained in intensity yesterday
but a cameroonian geology professor , isaac konfor njilah , said several thousand villagers faced danger from burning magma and poisonous gases
for example , lava tubes on active and dormant volcanoes may be dangerous to walk in because they can trap poisonous gases
by saturday night , nearly 48,000 people had taken shelter in schools , tents and other government buildings around the cone-shaped mountain , even though only 32,000 had been asked to move because of threats of lava flows , rocks and poisonous gases
it all hinges on the large amounts of water vapour and other gases dissolved in the liquid magma
experiments have shown that the amount of a dissolved gas in magma its solubility at atmospheric pressure is zero , but rises with increasing pressure
gases that were dissolved in the molten rock when it was deeper in the earth escape through open vents around the summit
griggs and his team found that the fumaroles were also emitting gases that had been dissolved in the molten rock before it erupted
gas that had been dissolved in the molten rock expanded and literally blew the volcano apart , filling the air with ash
lane uses pine sap together with acetone or ether to represent magma and the gas dissolved in it
the sudden removal of the upper part of the volcano by the landslides triggered the almost instantaneous expansion explosion of high temperature-high pressure steam present in cracks and voids in the volcano and of gases dissolved in the magma that caused the bulge of the cryptodome
gases dissolved in the magma provide the driving force behind an eruption when volcanoes get violent , new scientist , 26 october 1996 , p 28
back in the lab , garces and buckingham tweaked the parameters of the model slightly-adjusting the strength of the explosions , for instance , and the amount of gas dissolved in the magma
but as the molten rock rises , the pressure exerted by the weight of the rock above decreases , and gases dissolved in the magma begin to bubble out of solution
scientists believe the temperature and weight of the lava flowing into lake kivu could allow vast quantities of methane to escape from the bottom of the lake , covering both towns in toxic gas
these awesome features are heavier-than-air emulsions that move much like a snow avalanche , except that they are fiercely hot , contain toxic gases , and move at phenomenal , hurricane-force speeds , often over 100 km/hour
with such information in hand , scientists can construct so-called volcanic hazards maps that delineate the zones of greatest risk around the volcano and that designate which zones are particularly susceptible to certain types of volcanic hazards lava flows , ash fall , toxic gases , mudflows and associated flooding , etc.
but fires continued to burn there , the ground shook at regular intervals and experts said that while the volcano appeared to have spewed all its lava for now , toxic gas remained a danger
toxic gases seeping through the lava sting the eyes and clog the lungs
these dangerous eruptions are often associated with deadly pyroclastic flows composed of hot volcanic fragments and toxic gases that advance down slopes at hurricane-force speeds
visitors have to contend with toxic gases , noxious fumes , and showers of hot ash
amid choking clouds of toxic gas and dust , it smashed down the forest valley , burst through the american s living room , badly burnt his young daughter - then inexplicably stopped dead in a corridor in the middle of the house
these avalanches of hot lava fragments and toxic gases have killed thousands of people throughout history
chemical reactions are responsible for two types of toxic gas mixtures that are a particular problem for residents and tourists on the the big island of hawaii
runny lava flows in rivers of red-hot molten rock , but pasty lava creeps forward only about ten feet a day
build up of the high gas pressures required to fragment this somewhat pasty lava , results in episodic explosions with booming blasts
when the pahoehoe crust thickens and the underlying lava becomes cool , viscous , and gas-depleted , pasty lava can squeeze up through the axial fracture of the tumulus like cold toothpaste
however , true strombolian activity is characterized by short-lived , explosive outbursts of pasty lava ejected a few tens or hundreds of meters into the air
but if the lava is thick and pasty highly viscous , the gases will not move freely but will build up tremendous pressure , and ultimately escape with explosive violence
pasty lava looks more like clumps of fused stone
following the 1980 explosive eruption , more than a dozen extrusions of thick , pasty lava built a mound-shaped lava dome in the new crater
two of the most common kinds of basaltic lava have the hawaiian names aa and pahoehoe
for example , lapilli-size fragments of basaltic lava may cool quickly while airborne , to form glassy teardrop-shaped lapilli called pele s tears
lava flows on io have many of the same characteristics as the low-viscosity basaltic lava flows found on earth , as demonstrated in the images below
these hot thermal waters then ascend back through the overlying crust , where they leach out silica and numerous metals from the basaltic lava
shield cones are broad , slightly domed volcanoes built primarily of fluid , basaltic lava
because of their low silica content , basaltic lavas are usually very fluid
this implies that the mantle plume currently generating basaltic lavas on the big island has been in existence for at least 70 million year ! the hawaiians were very good at recognizing the difference in the older , eroded volcanic islands and newer islands to the southeast , where volcanic features are more pristine
they can occur as discrete volcanoes on basaltic lava fields , or as parasitic cones generated by flank eruptions on shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes
basaltic lava , with a louver silica content about 50 percent , is more fluid and may travel a long distance before congealing
its low rim is composed of loose pieces of basaltic lava and wallrocks sandstone , shale , limestone of the underlying diatreme , as well as random chunks of ancient crystalline rocks blasted upward from great depths
over the past 800 years , hekla has had a history of generating violent initial eruptions of pumice , lasting a few hours , followed by prolonged extrusion of basaltic lava from the lower part of the chamber
the pu u o o eruptive series , for example , has been erupting basaltic lava on the kilauea shield volcano since 1983
however , during the end stages of scoria-cone formation , it is not unusual for strombolian activity to wane and give way to the calm extrusion of basaltic lava flows
the low viscosity of basaltic lavas allows them to be extruded over great distances , often producing high-volume lava flows with low aspect ratios ratio of thickness to area
explosive hydrovolcanic eruptions of basaltic lava are sometimes called surtseyan , after the eruption off iceland in 1963
the frequent outpouring of basaltic lava on kilauea is a fitting reminder to the faithful that pele is alive and well
in some eruptions , basaltic lava pours out quietly from long fissures instead of central vents and floods the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow , forming broad plateaus
here , numerous fissure eruptions extruded very fluid basaltic lava
how do magmas of different compositions for ? why do volcanoes in the deep-ocean basins primarily extrude basaltic lava hawaii , whereas those adjacent to oceanic trenches extrude mainly andesitic lava mount st
the tube morphology provides a very efficient mechanism for basaltic lava flows to travel great distances away from their source without significant heat loss
shield volcanoes are built primarily of basaltic lava flows and contain only a small percentage of pyroclastic material
basaltic lava flows erupt primarily from shield volcanoes , fissure systems , and scoria cones
basaltic lava is less than 50 percent silica
backgroun : there are a large numbers of volcanic landforms in the national park that are common on shield volcanoes and on volcanic landscapes made of basaltic lava
the crustal rocks are composed of basaltic lavas
calderas are associated with tholeiitic lavas , the same type of basaltic lava that makes up the bulk of hawaiian shield volcanoes
thus , eruptions of these fluid basaltic lavas such as those that occur in hawaii , are relatively quiet
although highly effusive eruptions may advance downslope as massive sheets of basaltic lava , such flows are rare in the historic record
when fluid basaltic lavas of the hawaiian type congeal , they commonly form a relatively smooth skin that wrinkles as the still-molten subsurface lava continues to advance figure 4.6a
basaltic lava has a silica content of about 50 percent and , when molten , is a runny as honey
lava shields , a shield volcano made of basaltic lava
basaltic lava
the chilling and crystallization of basaltic lava around the sides , bottom , and top of lava channels produces a rock-encased conduit called a lava tube
plinian eruptions can last less than a day , such as the short-lived explosions of gas-rich , siliceous magma prior to the eruption of fluid basaltic lava flows in iceland
these are believed to be basaltic lava flows on a scale that dwarfs anything found on earth
as basaltic lava erupts at the surface , more or less continuously for millions of years , it is constantly accreted onto the edge of the spreading plates as it cools into a hardened basalt layer
volumetrically , most lava is of basaltic composition
the lava lakes have been investigated in detail because they furnish natural crucibles for study of the cooling , crystallization , and chemical change of basaltic lava
by contrast , basaltic lavas , which contain less silica , tend to be more fluid and have been known to travel distances exceeding 150 kilometers 90 miles before congealing figure 4.5
however , felsic lavas tend to be much thicker than basaltic lavas and have much higher aspect ratios
strombolian eruption , a type of volcanic eruption characterized by jetting of clots or fountains of fluid basaltic lava from a central crater
the thick accumulation of laterally extensive basaltic lava flows that result from basaltic flood eruptions are called plateau or flood basalts williams and mcbirney , 1979
shield volcanoes are built primarily of fluid basaltic lava flows and contain only a small percentage of pyroclastic materials
at over 2,192\b0f 1,200\b0c , basaltic lava is much hotter than andesitic 1,832\b0f/1,000\b0c and dacitic 1,472\b0f/800\b0c lavas
pyroclastics when basaltic lava is extruded
as shown in the image here , io s surface is extraordinarily colorful , with yellows , oranges , reds , and blacks reflecting compositionally diverse eruptions , from great outpourings of basaltic lava to massive deposits of sulfur
the effusion rates for historical eruptions of basaltic lava are highly variable , from 0.5 to 5000 m3/sec
the crust under the ocean is thin , so lava here is basaltic , uncontaminated by other rocks , and very runny
quenching and fragmentation of basaltic lavas produces an accumulation of angular , glassy fragments called hyaloclastite
basaltic lava with a surface of rough , jagged blocks is called aa
each mare is composed of vast sheets of basaltic lava which erupted from the broken crust associated with large impact craters
tourists always want to see the red stuff, said usgs geologist tari mattox as she led me along a stream of basaltic lava flowing from a vent in kilauea
rather than producing vast outpourings of basaltic lava , as occurs at oceanic sites such as hawaii , magma from the rising plume is emplaced at depth
another common basaltic lava has a surface of rough , jagged blocks with dangerously sharp edges and spiny projections , called aa pronounced ah-ah figure 4.6b
they eject relatively viscous basaltic lava from the throat of the volcano
the term flood basalts describes the fluid , water-like , basaltic lava flows that cover an extensive region in the northwestern united states known as the columbia plateau
the injection of basaltic lava into surface water can be quiescent or highly explosive
etna , for example , are dominanted by basaltic lava flows , whereas mt
the more common ones are aa , a rough jumbled lava with a dense interior , and pahoehoe , a smooth or ropey lava
they immediately suspected an active volcan : only it could melt such a large area of ice

subglacial eruptions produced pillow basalts porter , 1987
when basalt enters water passively , it forms pillow basalt
typically , the lava quenches quickly against the bottom waters to produce characteristic bulbous shapes called pillow basalt
pillow basalts
fissure eruptions are common along mid-ocean ridges and produce pillow basalts
basalt fragmentation can occur by the explosive eruption process , or by an essentially nonexplosive process associated with the spalling of pillow basalt rinds by thermal shock or chill shattering
on top of the dikes lies cooled , fractured lava called pillow basalt , rife with cracks and voids through which seawater circulates
the compositional spectrum of these rock types may vary from basalt to rhyolite in a single volcano; however , the overall average composition of stratovolcanoes is andesitic
the magma produced by this mechanism varies from basalt to andesite in composition
scoria cones are generated by strombolian eruptions , which produce eruptive columns of basalt tephra generally only a few hundred meters high

the mare lava flows are associated with a number of volcanic vents , in the form of domes and scoria cones
strombolian pyroclastic activity began at the site the following day and by the end of the day it generated a 40-m-high scoria cone
two end-member genetic types of airfall deposits are recognize : scoria-fall deposits -- these are derived from strombolian eruptions of scoria cones
typically , these eruptions form scoria cones composed of basaltic pryoclasts
many inactive scoria cones , on the other hand , may be viewed as extinct shortly after they erupt , because such volcanoes are typically monogenetic and only erupt once
scoria cones are composed almost wholly of ejected basaltic tephra
unlike the other two main volcano types , scoria cones have straight sides and very large summit craters , with respect to their relatively small edifices
the form and composition of the three main volcano types are summarized her : volcano typ : scoria cone , shield volcano , stratovolcano eruption type : strombolian , hawaiian , plinian
scoria cones are generated by strombolian eruptions , which produce eruptive columns of basalt tephra generally only a few hundred meters high
lava flows , for example , are more common in relatively non-explosive basaltic eruptions associated with sheild volcanoes , scoria cones , and fissures
where scoria cones have been breached , they typically reveal red-oxidized interiors
basaltic lava flows erupt primarily from shield volcanoes , fissure systems , and scoria cones
scoria cones
many scoria cones are monogenetic in that they only erupt once , in contrast to shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes
an exception is the cerro negro volcano in nicaragua , which is the earth s most historically active scoria cone
scoria cones , also known as cinder cones , are the most common type of volcano
the edifice has very steep slopes , up to 35 degrees , although older eroded scoria cones typically have gentler slopes , from 15 to 20 degrees
pyroclastic deposits are minor < 1% and of limited dispersal , generally from flank eruptions associated with parasitic scoria cones , or from rare , localized hydrovolcanic eruptions
the final height of the scoria cone was 424 m
the lunar scoria cones are similar in size to terrestrial scoria cones , and they appear to be associated with older fissure systems

the lack of lava or pyroclastic material on the rim of the craters indicates that they are not formed by eruptions

devastating mudflows or floods or both could be triggered by any or all of the followin : heavy rainfall during storms , melting of snow and ice by hot eruptive products especially pyroclastic flows , or sudden failure of one of the lakes impounded by the debris avalanche deposits
as might be expected , when the hot material of the debris avalanche and the even hotter pyroclastic flows encountered bodies of water or moist ground , the water flashed explosively to steam; the resulting phreatic steam-blast explosions sent plumes of ash and steam as high as 1.2 miles above the ground

helens , which erupted on may 18 , 1980 , in a wooded area of washington state , creating a rapid and sudden flowing of rock and other materials known as a ``debris avalanche. italy s mount vesuvius , which erupted in ad 79 , covering the ancient cities of pompeii and herculanium , is another example of a sudden volcanic eruption
debris avalanches are single events that occur rapidly moore and others , 1989

helens eruption in a matter of hours caused loss of lives and widespread destruction of valuable property , primarily by the debris avalanche , the lateral blast , and the mudflows
what appear to be blades of mown grass are actually large trees , some over 100 feet tall , flattened by the tremendous force of the lateral blast , even out to distances as far as 19 miles from the volcano photograph by daniel dzurisin.although the lateral blast began some seconds later than the debris avalanche , the blast s velocity was much greater , so that it soon overtook the avalanche
helens north flank , which produced the debris avalanche and triggered the ensuing violent lateral and vertical eruptions
covering an area of about 24 square miles , the debris avalanche advanced more than 13 miles down the north fork of the toutle river and filled the valley to an average depth of about 150 feet; the total volume of the deposit was about 0.7 cubic mile
the largest and most destructive mudflows , however , were those that developed several hours later in the north fork of the toutle river , when the water-saturated parts of the massive debris avalanche deposits began to slump and flow
they include debris avalanches more than 125 miles long, he told me
the abrupt pressure release , or uncorking, of the volcano by the debris avalanche can be compared in some ways to the sudden removal of the cap or a thumb from a vigorously shaken bottle of soda pop , or to punching a hole in a boiler tank under high pressure
debris avalanches moved on an overall slope <31/4 , disrupted the flanks of the volcano to produce individual blocks , and formed amphitheaters at their heads and hummocky terrain in their lower parts

the magma is continuing to ooze upward , cracking open the remains of the old dome and daily sending three to four avalanches of debris down the slopes
the volume of the uncompacted ash is equivalent to about 0.05 cubic mile of solid rock , or only about 7 percent of the amount of material that slid off in the debris avalanche
moore and others 1989 identified two types of landslide : slumps and debris avalanches
the dumping of avalanche debris into spirit lake raised its bottom by about 295 feet and its water level by about 200 feet

the leading front of the lateral blast now had completely overtaken the debris avalanche
within the next 15 seconds , the north flank of the volcano began to ripple and churn up , without moving laterally. at the same time the stoffels were witnessing from the air the developing debris avalanche , a remarkable series of ground-based photographs was being taken by keith ronnholm and gary rosenquist from bear meadows , a camping area located about 11 miles northeast of mount st

their summits have collapsed and their flanks have crumbled in huge debris avalanches
because of their rapid movement and large volume , debris avalanches generate tsunami
the series of slide blocks merged downslope into a gigantic debris avalanche , which moved northward at speeds of 110 to 155 miles an hour
this continues , building up the cone until it can t support itself. later we visited debris from the avalanche - chunks of rock hundreds of feet tall , standing like mini-mountains on the flat plain

according to fisk and his colleagues on the nrc committee , debris avalanches , lahars , and floods pose the most likley hazard at mount rainier
helens as a reference , volcanologists have recognized evidence for more than 400 prehistoric debris avalanches 4
helens victims died by asphyxiation from inhaling hot volcanic ash , and some by thermal and other injuries.the lateral blast , debris avalanche , mudflows , and flooding caused extensive damage to land and civil works
destructive mudflows and debris flows began within minutes of the onset of the may 18 eruption , as the hot pyroclastic materials in the debris avalanche , lateral blast , and ash falls melted snow and glacial ice on the upper slopes of mount st
tsunami caused by debris avalanches reached heights of 230 feet 70 m on molokai and 1,065 feet 325 m on lanai

debris avalanches
most of the may 18 , 1980 deposits in the upper valley of the north fork toutle river and in the vicinity of spirit lake are from the debris avalanche
the latter has been the source of large debris avalanches and pyroclastic and lava flows
the high-velocity lateral blast cloud , with its clearly visible trajectory trails of large blocks , was overtaking the slower moving debris avalanche
a mixture of these materials is a debris avalanche
helens in turn featured a giant volcanic landslide - a debris avalanche---and the associated lateral blast see the figure
significant avalanches of debris from the sherman crater area could have swept directly into the reservoir , triggering a disastrous wave that would have caused loss of life and damage to the reservoir
the collapse of the north face of the mountain produced an avalanche of debris that filled 60 square kilometres of the north fork of the toutle river valley to a depth of 45 metres within 10 minutes
within a few seconds after the onset and mobilization of the debris avalanche , the climactic eruptions of may 18 began as the sudden unloading of much of the volcano s north flank abruptly released the pent-up pressure of the volcanic system
the potential for mudflows and floods was increased by the existence of new ponds and lakes formed when the debris avalanche of may 1980 blocked parts of the preexisting drainage to serve as natural dams
for instance , mount st helens in washington switched between lava dome growth and violent eruptions several times between may and october 1980 , and geologists are naturally keen to know why
this viscous lava dome began to erupt in 1922 and is still growing toda ! an empirical example of dome growth through time is shown in the illustration below for the mt
more small explosions occurred during the spring and summer months , and on september 10-12 a large lava lobe was extruded , accompanied by major distention of the north part of the dome at unprecedented rates that approached 120 feet per da ! dramatic dome growth during the 1981-85 perio : top viewed in august 1981 from a camera station at a distance of about 0.5 mile; the dome is about 535 feet high , or nearly as tall as the george washington monument
visual monitoring is supported by remote video surveillance of the crater area and by still photography and video recording of dome growth patterns and block-and-ash flow emplacement
the roles of magma supply and ascent rates , degassing and crystallization , and other controls on explosive eruptions and dome growth were tested and quantified 1 /0
small pyroclastic flows accompanied growth of the dome.scientists were worried that this eruption might trigger a giant landslide from augustine s steep upper cone , which could enter the sea to create a tsunami powerful seismic sea wave
slow growth of the dome took place more or less continuously throughout 1983 , accompanied at times by small explosions from a crater at the crest of the dome
the may and august episodes reverted to the nonexplosive style and involved only dome growth
such activity could include the outpouring of lava flows not observed to date , as well as renewed dome growth and small-to-moderate explosive events
an extremely destructive eruption accompanied the growth of a dome at mont pel\e9e in 1902
helens could similarly remain active for several decades , and continuing dome growth ultimately may fill the crater to form a new conical summit photograph courtesy of the kamchatka volcanological station
moreover , the rate of sulfur dioxide release had progressively decreased with time , suggesting that the magma was running out of gas. thus , scientists were not surprised that no dome growth took place during the last 3 years of the 1980s
since october 1996 , a new dome has filled in the explosion vent , and pyroclastic flows have resumed however , dome growth has been episodic , out of phase with swarms of unusual earthquakes that probably reflect magma fracture during injection; the southern crater wall began to shed large rock slides in response to earthquakes in these swarms , and concerns were raised about its stability , fearing a massive depressurization of the dome and conduit behind the wall
the eruption will consist primarily of dome growth. advisory update
repeating the cycle again and again , dome growth and explosion have slowly escalated in scale at soufriere hills
its surface is often rough and blocky as a result of fragmentation of the cooler , outer crust during growth of the dome
the eruption will consist primarily of dome growth , but as with all dome growth , minor explosive activity is also possible. eruption alert :55 a.m. , august 17 seismicity and rates of deformation in the crater have accelerated sharply
dome growth followed this explosion
as the southwestern side of the dome collapsed , a cloud of ash , rock , and superheated gases-called a pyroclastic flow-raced down the mountain to the sea at more than 100 miles 161 kilometers an hour
to a swiss woman curious about the steaming lump , i explained dome collapse and pyroclastic flows
however , even then portions of the lava dome may collapse into dangerous flows of hot ash , or the lava dome can explode unexpectedly as at mount unzen
u is for unzen unzen volcano , in japan , first made history in 1792 , when the collapse of its dome resulted in tsunami that bit the shores of japanese provinces killing around 14,500 people
the blast that the japanese researchers measured came just five days after a massive flow of hot ash and debris from a dome collapse killed 43 people in kita-kamikoba , a town directly in the firing line of the volcano s east-lacing vent
but such close-up , derailed observations pose extreme danger , and the fury unleashed by a dome collapse can turn expensive instruments into scorched , shattered hulks
although the term nu\e9e ardente is now applied to all pyroclastic flows generated by dome collapse , it is somewhat of a misnomer to describe these features as a glowing cloud. a more precise term would be glowing avalanche
gravity or internal pressure can cause the dome to collapse , resulting in hot block-and ash flows
pel\e9e in 1902 , and with the genration of pyroclastic flows from dome collapse
the researchers measured the shock wave created by a dome collapse on june 8 , 1991 , and then calculated the pent-up energy required to generate it - the equivalent of about 12,000 tons of tnt
in some cases , dome collapse is attributed to explosive eruption at the summit crater
a collapsing dome sends rivers of superheated rock , ash and gases down the mountain s flanks
part of the dome collapsed , and rocks shot sideways out of the crater
this scenario is not wholly imaginative , as on 17 to 18 september 1996 , when profound dome collapse led to conduit depressurization and then to an intensive , explosive , nearly vertical eruption column that lasted for nearly an hour
so the lava sprays out of the ground in a fountain of fire , or wells out as a stream of molten rock
clouds of ash the volcano , europe s highest at 10,900 feet , pumped out huge dark clouds of ash and spurted fountains of magma 300 to 600 feet into the air
to photograph tessier in one of mutnovsky s steaming craters , peter grappled not only with stinging eyes and his own cumbersome gas mask but also with his gear
from a corner stared a dried and cracked gas mask
at that time it simply wasn t standard practice for volcanologists to use lots of safety gear , except for gas masks , which many of us brought with us that day
as we approach , a rising wind and thick clouds of chlorine gas force us to pause and pull on safety helmets and industrial-style gas masks that cover our noses and mouths
as we approach its lip , the 39-year-old tessier--a genial and easygoing french biologist with impressive rope and rock-climbing skills honed by years of adventures like this one--rips off his gas mask and begins to hoot with pleasure
minutes after the initial explosion , the island was plunged into darkness , cars and trucks began slipping and sliding on roads coated with ash , and people headed home as if through a winter blizzard , their faces covered with surgical or gas masks and their hair coated a ghostly white
armed with guts and a gas mask , explorer franck tessier faces toxic steam from kamchatka s volcanoes
gas masks are needed when researching eruptions that include sulfur dioxide
he also didn t instruct any of the group to bring safety gear on the expedition , and most of them went into the volcano without hard hats or adequate gas masks
in early 1994 , researchers noticed that the flank stopped moving after pressure in the magma reservoir dropped slightly
the essential feature of a composite volcano is a conduit system through which magma from a reservoir deep in the earth s crust rises to the surface
macdonald 1965 concluded that calderas grow by piecemeal collapse above the shallow magma reservoir
the data from this systematic gas monitoring show that the changes in composition of the emissions can be related to the inflation swelling and deflation shrinking of the magma reservoir
mauna loa s magma reservoir also may be larger than kilauea s , which would be consistent with the observations that mauna loa eruptions tend to be characterized by higher lava-output rates , longer eruptive fissures , and larger lava flows
during summit eruptions , the magma reservoir deflates only slightly , if at all
whether this is so is a topic of scientific debate , because abundant chemical and physical evidence indicates that each volcano has its own shallow magma reservoir that operates independently of the other
the rocks continue to settle until their weight is balanced by the pressure of magma in the reservoir the collapse or sag at the summit produces the caldera
calderas are large steep-walled depressions that form when a volcano s summit region collapses , usually after a large eruption empties or partly empties a reservoir of magma beneath the volcano
79 , may be sitting atop a reservoir of magma that covers more than 400 square kilometers , a new study suggests
cut-away view looking deep beneath kilauea volcano , showing the shallow magma reservoir and the principal magma passageways
the overlying rocks act like a giant piston and push down on the magma reservoir
the formation of a caldera probably requires the presence of a magma reservoir within a few miles kilometers of the summit of the shield volcano macdonald , 1965
however , once eruption begins , the shrinking or deflation of the volcano typically occurs rapidly as pressure on the magma reservoir is relieved -- a process not unlike deflating a balloon
inser : prior to any change in the volcano , a balance is reached between the outward mostly upward pressure of the magma in the reservoir beneath the summit and the downward weight of the rocks above the magma reservoir
as more magma fills the reservoir , pressure builds
patterns of small earthquakes suggested that the magma reservoir was smaller and deeper than inferred from exhumed roots of older strato-volcanoes 9
surface water percolates downward through the rocks below the earth s surface to high-temperature regions surrounding a magma reservoir , either active or recently solidified but still hot
as magma fills the reservoir beneath the summit , the volcano inflates and the tilt of the flanks increases , sometimes very rapidly
kilauea s eruptions are so intensely monitored that scientists have assembled a detailed picture of the volcano s magma reservoir plumbing system and how it behaves before and during eruptions
the model consists of two main elements , a magma reservoir a few kilometers beneath the volcano s summit and a fault under the mountain s south flank
the gas ratios should help researchers gauge the stamina of each of etna s now five active vents by determining which are drawing from the main magma reservoir
the second holds that when the magma reservoir beneath the island emptied , it sucked a mass of water down , setting the surrounding ocean in motion
the krakatau eruption served as a reminder of how a large eruption can create a void in the magma reservoir , into which a roof several kilometers in thickness can collapse
monitoring instruments placed at the volcano s summit can used to trace the cycles of gradual inflation , in which the reservoir fills with magma , and abrupt deflation when the reservoir partially empties to deliver magma to an eruption
scientists do not know the cause of these ups and downs but hypothesize that they are related to the addition or withdrawal of magma beneath the caldera , or to the changing pressure of the hot ground water system above yellowstone s large magma reservoir
as magma moves into the reservoir during inflation , it must make room for itself by rupturing or crowding aside the solidified lava that surrounds the reservoir
prior to the eruption , a reservoir of magma existed in the east rift zone beneath the present location of the puu oo vent
the picture that emerged , the researchers report , includes a magma reservoir buried eight kilometers deep in the earth s crust that is at least 400 square kilometers wide
in many volcanoes it pauses in a reservoir called a magma chamber some 7 to 10 kilometres below the surface
instead , it accumulates in a network of small fractures , forming a reservoir of magma at a depth of around 20 kilometres , near the base of the crust
magma that erupts from the flank of a volcano must first flow underground through one of the volcano s rift zones , sometimes traveling more than 30 kilometers from the summit magma reservoir before breaking the surface
the mare lava flows are associated with a number of volcanic vents , in the form of domes and scoria cones
strombolian pyroclastic activity began at the site the following day and by the end of the day it generated a 40-m-high scoria cone
two end-member genetic types of airfall deposits are recognize : scoria-fall deposits -- these are derived from strombolian eruptions of scoria cones
typically , these eruptions form scoria cones composed of basaltic pryoclasts
many inactive scoria cones , on the other hand , may be viewed as extinct shortly after they erupt , because such volcanoes are typically monogenetic and only erupt once
scoria cones are composed almost wholly of ejected basaltic tephra
unlike the other two main volcano types , scoria cones have straight sides and very large summit craters , with respect to their relatively small edifices
the form and composition of the three main volcano types are summarized her : volcano typ : scoria cone , shield volcano , stratovolcano eruption type : strombolian , hawaiian , plinian
scoria cones are generated by strombolian eruptions , which produce eruptive columns of basalt tephra generally only a few hundred meters high
lava flows , for example , are more common in relatively non-explosive basaltic eruptions associated with sheild volcanoes , scoria cones , and fissures
where scoria cones have been breached , they typically reveal red-oxidized interiors
basaltic lava flows erupt primarily from shield volcanoes , fissure systems , and scoria cones
scoria cones
many scoria cones are monogenetic in that they only erupt once , in contrast to shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes
an exception is the cerro negro volcano in nicaragua , which is the earth s most historically active scoria cone
scoria cones , also known as cinder cones , are the most common type of volcano
the edifice has very steep slopes , up to 35 degrees , although older eroded scoria cones typically have gentler slopes , from 15 to 20 degrees
pyroclastic deposits are minor < 1% and of limited dispersal , generally from flank eruptions associated with parasitic scoria cones , or from rare , localized hydrovolcanic eruptions
the final height of the scoria cone was 424 m
the lunar scoria cones are similar in size to terrestrial scoria cones , and they appear to be associated with older fissure systems
another category of ejecta far more common than volcanic bombs is scoria or cinder , which refers to lapilli- or bomb-size irregular fragments of frothy lava
another category of ejecta far more common than volcanic bombs is scoria or cinder , which refers to lapilli- or bomb-size irregular fragments of frothy lava
thus , they are chilled and solid by the time they hit the ground , where they accumulate as cindery fragments called scoria

the mauna loa volcano on the big island of hawaii , seen here in both a oblique and satellite views , is the world s largest shield volcan : shield volcanoes are generated by hawaiian eruptions
this process creates a protrusion of cheesy basalt commonly called a squeeze-up
fluid basalt will more commonly move down slope by creating its own channelways above gently sloping terrains , or by flowing down in pre-existing stream channels
17 million years ago , huge molten-basalt flows from a hot spot created the columbia plateau in oregon and washington
oceanic crust is made of relatively dense rock called basalt
shield volcanoes are made of thousands of thin basalt lava flows
they contain more sodium and/or potassium than the shield-building basalts that make the bulk of the volcano
the islands of hawaii are made of basalt , a rock that consist of the minerals olivine , pyroxene , and plagioclase , and is relatively rich in iron and magnesium and poor in silica
on the other hand , if an oceanic plate made of dense basalt hits a low-density continental plate then the former will plunge underneath , pushing back into the hot , convecting mantle
basalt is dark volcanic rock made up of small crystals and glass , whereas dacite , while also glassy or fine-grained , generally is much lighter in color
when basalt enters water passively , it forms pillow basalt
because these lavas are more viscous stickier than basalt , they tend to form thicker flows that travel shorter distances from the vent; consequently , andesite and dacite lavas typically build tall cones with steep slopes of more than 20 degrees
where the melt forms from a subducted plate , basalt-magma blobs rise up against the underside of the continental crust
the large scale of the tharsis shield volcanoes suggests that they formed from massive eruptions of fluid basalt over prolonged periods of time
massive fissure eruptions in the geological past have generated extraordinarily voluminous lava flows that form large continental flood basalt provinces
whereas basalt forms a a and pahoehoe lava , andesite generally produces blocky lava , which contains smooth-sided , angular fragments blocks that are not as splintery or vesicular as a a lava fragments
hall rested rocks in a hot iron foundry and showed that molten basalt forms crystals if cooled slowly
the hexagonal columns of fingal s cave in scotland were formed by flood basalts , which can spill from fissures in the crust to form plateaus hundreds of feet deep
since komatiites were discovered in 1969 , the prevailing theory held that they formed , like the basalt lavas common today , at shallow depths and low pressures
23 catherine hickson above examines columns of basalt formed from cooling lava about 10,000 years ago near today s whistler , b.c
almost all of the magma erupted from hawaii s volcanoes forms dark gray to black volcanic rock called basalt , generally in the form of lava flows and , less commonly , as fragmented lava such as volcanic bombs , cinders , pumice , and ash
a littoral cone is a cone formed on a lava flow when it runs into a body of water , usually the sea
the volcano , called the lathrop wells cone , lies about 20 kilometers from the proposed location for the underground waste repository
majestic cones can turn into lethal monsters
much as it does on land , the cone cools and turns solid , then a new lava flow breaks out from it , running down the flanks and beginning the process of making an undersea mountain
the overnight eruptions , televised live , lit up the sky with bright red sprays and turned the cone into a twinkling incandescent carpet
fissure eruptions and lava plateaus we think of volcanic eruptions as building a cone or mountain from a central vent
later volcanic activity built a small cinder cones in the lake called wizard island , which today provides a mute reminder of past activity figure 4.19
their overall broad shapes result from the extrusion of very fluid low viscosity basalt lava that spreads outward from the summit area , in contrast to the vertical accumulation of airfall tephra around scoria-cone vents , and the build-up of viscous lava and tephra around stratovolcanoes
powerful fountaining episodes hurled molten rock 450 meters into the air and built a cone of lava fragments that quickly became the tallest landmark on the rift zone
because these lavas are more viscous stickier than basalt , they tend to form thicker flows that travel shorter distances from the vent; consequently , andesite and dacite lavas typically build tall cones with steep slopes of more than 20 degrees
some ejected material may land near the vent and build a cone structure , whereas smaller particles will be carried great distances by the wind
they are typically steep-sided , symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows , volcanic ash , cinders , blocks , and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases
explosive eruptions caused by gas rapidly expanding and escaping from molten lava formed cinders that fell back around the vent , building up the cone to a height of 1,200 feet
cinder cones are built from ejected lava fragments and are usually less than 300 meters 1000 feet high
was formed about 1,340 years ago in a process called fire-fountaining , where lava boils like a pot of porridge and spews showers of basaltic bombs which build up the cone
the most voluminous of these post-caldera eruptions have built the volcanic cone of wizard island on the western side of the lake
after centuries of sporadic ejections of lava and ash that built its scenic cone , st
these built an aesthetically pleasing cone , while finer ash fell over a much larger area , burning and eventually covering the village of paricutin
the tephra accumulates near the central vent and builds a cinder cones
heat from friction melts the crust , releasing magma that erupts and builds rows of cones such as the cascade range
with successive eruptions , however , they can still build up into huge , cone-shaped peaks such as mount kilimanjaro in tanzania
a fountain of molten rock builds a new cone , which rose 300 feet 90 meters in just six days
and , since mars has no moving plates , the hot spot keeps pumping up magma in the same place , building up the volcano s cone
composite volcano , a steep volcanic cone built by both lava flows and pyroclastic eruptions
rather than building a cone , these long , narrow cracks pour forth a low-viscosity hawaiian-type lava , blanketing a wide area
alternating layers of ash and lava build up a steep cone , known as a stratovolcano or composite cone
helens and the eruptive histories of other cascade volcanoes continue to improve public awareness and understanding of these potentially dangerous peaks.in contrast to kilauea , cascade volcanoes erupt a variety of magma types that generate a wide range of eruptive behavior and build steepsided cones known as composite volcanoes
cinder cone , a volcanic cone built entirely of loose fragmented material pyroclastics
this continues , building up the cone until it can t support itself. later we visited debris from the avalanche - chunks of rock hundreds of feet tall , standing like mini-mountains on the flat plain
during 9 years of activity , par\edcutin built a prominent cone , covered about 100 square miles with ashes , and destroyed the town of san juan
cinder cones as the name suggests , cinder cones are built from ejected lava fragments
the highest volcanic landform of historic age in hawaii is the cone being built by the 1983-to-present pu u o o eruption
end of eruptions from puu oo in all , 44 episodes of high fountaining at the puu oo vent built a cinder-and-spatter cone 842 feet 257 m high and covered 15 square miles 40 square km with lava
spatter cone , a low , steep-sided cone of spatter built up on a fissure or vent
a cone can build so steeply that it can t support itself and so collapses in huge landslides that send debris miles down-slope - a process discovered in hawaii
growth profiles of kilauea s newest volcanic cone , built during the pu u o o eruption
a spatter cone is a low , steep-sided cone of spatter built up on fissure or vent; it is usually of basaltic material bates and jackson , 1980 , p
eruptions of andesitic lava flows between 1953 and 1960 built a new cone on trident s southwest flank , adding yet another to the volcano s older complex of three overlapping cones hence the name trident
four days later , episode 51 started from a fissure on the puu oo cone slightly higher than the episode 50 fissure
in 1943 a cinder cones started growing on a farm near the village of par\edcutin in mexico
sunshine yellow sulfur coats some of the crater s sheer rock faces
although large eruptions and lava flows are uncommon , smaller eruptions occur very frequently and often hurl blobs of lava above the crater rim
the gases , lava and flying rocks hurled from the depths make the crater far too dangerous for human exploration
such collapses , in turn , could hurl rock fragments onto the crater floor and possibly trigger small pyroclastic flows through the crater breach and down the north flank of the mountain toward spirit lake
scientists want to find out how often these debris flows sweep down a mountainside without warning
whenever the composite dome enlarges , chances increase for collapses of its steep , irregular sides
helens from johnston ridge on march 30 , 1987 photograph by lyn topinka; through april 1990 , the composite dome inside the crater has not enlarged since the last eruptive period in october 1986
sticky dacite magmas 65 percent silica tend to form lava domes , like mount st
pfs are formed by the collapse of lava domes or by blasts that blow out the side of a mountain or explode skyward , then fall back to earth and spread for miles
for neuberg , this pattern sounds the alarm that the dome is about to blow--as happened in july 2001 , showering the nearby village of salem with cherry-sized pumice stones

few nearby residents heeded earlier calls to evacuate the area as the lava dome grew to three times its usual size
a dome grows largely by expansion from within
:45 a.m. , august 18 the dome is already growing internally , but we have not seen any discrete event yet , for example , an explosion , a change in the character of seismicity or deformation
more than 500 similar small explosions occurred sporadically until 1986 , during times when the dome was not growing
considerable hazards still exist in the immediate vicinity of the volcano s present summit--the amphitheater-like crater , with its episodically active and growing composite lava dome
during this time , the dome grew not only as lava was added to its surface extrusion but also as magma entered and inflated the dome as if a water balloon were being filled intrusion
helens as a volcanic dome grew within the crater of the volcano
during the 1989-1990 eruption of redoubt volcano in alaska several lava domes grew and collapsed near the summit of the volcano
helens , a volcanic dome began to grow within the crater
the flow was generated from the explosive collapse of a growing lava dome at the summit of the volcano , which then swept down on the city

on montserrat , magma is pushing up into the crater , creating a bulging dome of jagged gray rock
a sluggish pace would create a lava dome
on sunday scientists had predicted that a large explosion , eclipsing the 1945 eruption that created a lava dome on the summit and ash falls in wellington , was imminent
consequently , a laccolith can occasionally be detected because of the dome it creates at the surface figure 4.22b
the lava , however , pours from a single vent , rather than a crack , creating a dome-shaped mountain
the researchers measured the shock wave created by a dome collapse on june 8 , 1991 , and then calculated the pent-up energy required to generate it - the equivalent of about 12,000 tons of tnt
more magma pushes against the dome , creating rockslides that expose fresh magma in a flash
collapse of a growing lava dome generates the nu\e9e ardente
the earth s longest historical dome-building event has generated the santiaguito dome in guatemala
one theory suggests that they are generated by dome formation within a rift , followed by localized extrusion of lava along one of the rift fractures
although the term nu\e9e ardente is now applied to all pyroclastic flows generated by dome collapse , it is somewhat of a misnomer to describe these features as a glowing cloud. a more precise term would be glowing avalanche
when usgs scientists recognize a potential hazard , such as an impending eruption , they notify the appropriate government officials , who in turn are responsible for advising the public to evacuate certain areas or to take other actions to insure their safety
these flank eruptions arise when magma beneath the summit exerts such pressure on the walls of the pipe or fissure in which it flows that the rock cracks
a volcano is essentially an opening or a vent through which this magma and the dissolved gases it contains are discharged
some mild eruptions merely discharge steam and other gases , whereas other eruptions quietly extrude quantities of lava
79 , great quantities of ash-laden gas are violently discharged to form cauliflower-shaped cloud high above the volcano
these new methods include monitoring the changes i : the composition and amount of volcanic gases discharged such as sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide , hydrogen , helium , and radon; the magnetic and gravitational fields of the volcano; and the various geoelectrical properties of the volcano

large eruption columns inject ash particles and sulfur-rich gases into the troposphere and stratosphere and these clouds can circle the globe within weeks of the volcanic activity
the scientists inject simulated volcanic gases through pipes at the base of the chimney
some of this froth is so light--because of the many gas bubbles--that it floats on water
oil tanks and gas tanks float away and spread burning oil around the place, said simon day of the benfield greig geohazard research centre at university college london
some of these emit only gases and are appropriately called fumaroles
the expanding gas component is derived from a combination of 1 the constant exsolution of volcanic gas emitted by the hot pyroclasts , and 2 from the ingestion , heating , and rapid expansion air during movement of the flow
the hard outer crust , known as desert pavement , formed quickly as the volcanic materials were weathered by wind , rain and the acidic gases emitted by the still sputtering volcano
the volcanologists made their discovery by comparing earthquake behavior with the amount of sulfur dioxide gas that galeras emitted prior to last year s jan
on goma s main street , three men carried furniture from a building that was next in line as the tide of lava flowed down the street emitting jets of acrid gas
griggs and his team found that the fumaroles were also emitting gases that had been dissolved in the molten rock before it erupted
helens continued to emit great quantities of hot gases and ash
f is for fumaroles these are vents in the crater or on the flanks of a volcano , which emit hot gases
volcanic gases are emitted during all types of eruptions
determining the timing of an eruption in a monitored volcano depends on measuring a number of parameters , including , but not limited to , seismic activity at the volcano especially depth and frequency of volcanic earthquakes , ground deformations determined using a tiltmeter and/or gps , and satellite interferometry , and gas emissions sampling the amount of sulfur dioxide gas emitted by correlation spectrometer , or cospec
fumaroles , which emit mixtures of steam and other gases , are fed by conduits that pass through the water table before reaching the surface of the ground
extremely small amounts of mercury and other metals have been detected in gases emitted from vents along the east rift zone of kilauea , but none have been found in concentrations large enough to create a direct health hazard
although the percentage may be small , the actual quantity of emitted gas can exceed thousands of tons per day
fumaroles are vents that often occur on the side of volcanoes , emitting thick , often sulfurous gas
in later years , realizing that gases emitted from volcanoes carry vital information about what is going on inside , mr
instruments on the mountain relay the seismic activity caused by smoke exhalations and deep molten-rock movements , tiny increases in volume which could indicate the build-up of pressure , and changes in the the gases emitted
explosive eruptions emit huge quantities of gases and fine-grained debris into the atmosphere
lava began gushing out of mayon s crater before dawn yesterday , accompanied by loud rumblings
like fissures , hawaiian eruptions gush lava and fire
a plume of volcanic ash shot seven kilometres into the air as smouldering boulders flew skyward and lava gushed from the glowing crater in albay province , 217 kilometres southeast of manila , the capital
the weight of lava above caused lava to gush freely from the vents , and for a few hellish hours rock flowing almost like water engulfed villagers , their livestock , and wild elephants on the slopes
from as safe a place as possible , the vulcanologist dips the pronged end of the rod into the lava flow and twists it
corrugated iron sheets twisted by the heat had bobbed on the surface of the lava
its frequent eruptions of runny magma tend to be gentle , but the vents sometimes spout glowing fountains of red-hot lava into the air
two cones rose on the flank with breathtaking speed , one spouting lava fountains as tall as 1,300 feet left
the volcano has spouted lava , ash and smoke intermittently since january last year etna last threatened inhabited areas in 1992 when lava streams headed towards zafferana , a town of 7,000 people crouched on the lower slopes
hawaiian eruptions typically start with lava fountains spouting from a series of nearly continuous fissures , curtains of fire. as most eruptions progress , lava-fountain activity becomes localized at a single vent an opening from which lava issues , generally within hours of the initial outbreak
these flank eruptions arise when magma beneath the summit exerts such pressure on the walls of the pipe or fissure in which it flows that the rock cracks
the mare lava flows are associated with a number of volcanic vents , in the form of domes and scoria cones
typically , these eruptions form scoria cones composed of basaltic pryoclasts
the magma which erupts from etna in the form of lava , ash and scoria a form of lava containing many bubbles of air , looking like cinders , forms by melting of rock in the earth s mantle , the layer immediately beneath the crust , at depths more than 30 kilometres below the surface
during the exceptionally high fountaining episodes of some eruptions , such as at kilauea iki in 1959 or at pu u o o all episodes , 1983 to present , an extremely vesicular , feathery light pumice , called reticulite or thread-lace scoria , can form and be carried many miles downwind from the high lava fountains
under montserrat lies the tectonic engine that drives the volcan : a subduction zone where the north and south american plates push beneath the caribbean plate and form the islands of the lesser antilles
how close did you actually end up getting to the volcan ? i landed on it , in the helicopter , while it was still flying , and very , very close

the last time fuji exploded , in 1707 , it belched a cloud of ash that blanketed tokyo , 70 miles away
it is indisputable when they occur , they cause catastrophic damage , but we also know their occurrence is very rare. the southern flank of the kilauea volcano on hawaii , a possible location of a future giant landslide , is continually in motion without posing any danger , sliding at a glacial rate of three to four inches a year
magma that has erupted onto the surface is called lava
also refers to the rocks and sediment deposited in that epoch
by comparing the intensity of the peaks at both poles , researchers have determined that the source of the explosion lay between the latitudes of 10 and 20 degrees north
it is also the second-poorest region , with 50.1% of residents living below the poverty threshold
pauses in the eruption stopped the supply of lava to the tubes several times in 1990
it is usually heavier , darker , and more crystalline than pumice
rocks collected from past trips to loihi show that during most eruptions on the young volcano , lava has oozed out slowly -- like toothpaste from a tube -- forming lobes of pillow lava
once established , lava channels will often develop lava levees along their lengths
the situation is getting more intense
when they overlaid their results with a map of population density near popo , they found nearly 100,000 people to be at risk from a major eruption see graphic

the local authorities raised the alert status in the farming region 200 miles south-east of manila to the maximum , meaning eruption in progress , yesterday morning
de-gassed magma can then rise to the surface and extrude in a less violent fashion , as dacite to rhyolite lava
a dormant volcano is a volcano that is not now erupting but has erupted in historic time , since written records were kept the last 200 years in hawaii , and is likely to do so in the future
fissure eruptions are quiescent , and the height of the airborne eruptive material is small , often only a few tens of meters
he was saved in a rescue led by two brave women colleagues , marta calvache and patty mothes , and by a young colombian neurosurgeon who removed a piece of his brain the size of a peach stone
earthquakes occur for similar reasons beneath mauna loa s southwest and southeast flanks
the brittle crust usually buckles to accommodate the inflating core of the flow , thus creating a central crack along the length of the tumulus
how vulnerable life can be in the shadow of an volcano became clear on the caribbean island of montserrat in june 1997
we are not going to risk our lives there, she said
severity of the hazard increases from zone 9 to zone 1
we became so scared we decided to leave, said judel mirandilla , 14 , of bonga village
the largest land area in the state is the island of hawaii , also called the big island. most of the population and major roads are in the coastal areas
during the opening stages of the eruption , violent glowing avalanches of hot ash travel down the flanks of the volcano
eventually , the east flank of this volcano collapsed , too
the eruption appears to have caught aid agencies in goma by surprise

they proposed that lava erupted at different times along the rift at the crest of the mid-ocean ridges preserved different magnetic anomalies
altogether , 11 volcanoes blew their tops on the same day as these big quakes , but only 5 or fewer erupted on any of the 1,000 days before or after
over this year , instruments have detected the ground inside the caldera warping upward by 5 centimeters , a dramatic jump over the gradual deformation seen in the last few years
build up of the high gas pressures required to fragment this somewhat pasty lava , results in episodic explosions with booming blasts
episode 53 began on february 20 , 1993 , as a new vent formed on the south side of the puu oo cone , adjacent to the episode 52 vent , and sent lava flows to the south

nonexplosive hawaiian-type eruptions often produce lapilli- to bomb-size fragments , called spatter which remain airborne for only a short amount of time so that are still liquid when they hit the ground surface
geologists must go into the field and map the preserved remnants of those eruptions one by one -- a hard , time-consuming , often frustrating process

that snow could become a killer if an eruption heated the mountain unexpectedly
the internal structure of this dome--defined by layering of lava fanning upward and outward from the center--indicates that it grew largely by expansion from within
this history of intermittent activity is one of the most important reasons why scientists continue to monitor the volcano to detect the intensive , sustained seismic activity and ground deformation that can be expected to accompany any massive infusion of new magma required to break the pattern of dome building in the 1980s and to feed an explosive eruption of major proportions

the pressure in the hollow tunnels would be much lower than in the surrounding rock , so once the magma broke through it would gush into the tunnels at tens or hundreds of metres per second
descriptions of earlier eruptions are sketchier , because they are based only on interpretations of ancient hawaiian chants and stories told by hawaiian elders and early european residents to the american missionaries

that s why studies of pinatubo and others are so important - they help us understand the conditions that precede really big explosions
these variations in eruption rate resemble those of real volcanoes , she says
eyewitness accounts indicated that the more voluminous pyroclastic flows originated by the upwelling of volcanic ejecta to heights below the rim of the crater , followed by lateral flow northward through the breach of the crater
